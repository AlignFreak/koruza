<p>The prototype of KORUZA system is under constant development to find the most effective and low-cost design enabling 1 Gbps connectivity of structures up to 100m apart. The current version heavily relies on 3D printing for producing the vast majority of parts possibly suitable for the construction out of plastics and is suitable for the outdoor use.</p>
